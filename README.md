# Example Program
Simple application used to explain Docker basics for a university project regarding Docker.

The application consists of a simple API using [Rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs/) which reads an environment variable and can write and read to the filesystem in a basic way.
These features have been chosen to exemplify the usage of ports and volumes in a Dockerfile.

This is not meant as a real-world example of any thing.
